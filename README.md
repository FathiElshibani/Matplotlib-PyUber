# Matplotlib-PyUber

you are given some Uber information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

The objective is to build a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:  
* Average Fare ($) Per City 
* Total Number of Rides Per City 
* Total Number of Drivers Per City 
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition to that, producing the following three pie charts:
* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type
